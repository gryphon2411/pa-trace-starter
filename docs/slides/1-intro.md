# PA-Trace 
## Evidence-Traced Prior Authorization Packet Drafter
<br>

*Tackling the $35B/year Prior Authorization bottleneck with MedGemma 4B*

</div>

<br><br>

### The Problem
* **Administrative Waste:** Clinicians spend 15–45 mins per case extracting evidence from unstructured notes.
* **The "Ping-Pong" Effect:** Missing evidence (e.g., conservative care history) causes rejections & delays care.

<br>

### The Solution: PA-Trace
An **on-device, agentic workflow** that turns a clinic note + imaging order + payer policy into a **submission-ready draft**.
* **Zero PHI exposure** (local MedGemma 4B).
* **100% Provenance Validity:** Every extracted field tracks back to an exact quote.
* **Principled Abstention:** Automatically abstains when evidence is missing.
